## How They Work Together
1. **Developer**: Creates an AI model using a framework like PyTorch.
2. **Framework**: Uses high-level libraries like cuDNN for efficient calculations.
3. **Libraries**: Use CUDA to send instructions to the GPU.
4. **CUDA**: Works with the GPU driver to execute instructions on the GPU hardware.
5. **GPU**: Performs calculations and sends results back up the chain.
6. **Framework**: Presents results to the developer or end-user application.
